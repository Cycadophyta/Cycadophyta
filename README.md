I am a molecular biologist, currently working as a Research Assistant at NIAB EMR. 

I am currently learning bioinformatics in preparation for my PhD, which I'm hoping to start in Oct 2021.
- I have been doing the Genomic Data Science specialisation course on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science). My work for this course can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/Cycadophyta/genomic-data-science/).
- I have also been working through some bioinformatics problems on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/about/). My work can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/Cycadophyta/rosalind/).

I have also been working on some IoT projects.
